Wraith is designed to be easy to deploy and use. For this reason
there are plans to include a builder which will build the executable
without the need for a Golang compiler.

The builder will build versions of Wraith for a number of platforms
like Windows, Linux and MacOS based on settings specfied by the user.

The current plan for implementing the builder involves hard-coding the
Wraith executable code within it and simply replacing certain data
with user-specified values.

Alternatively, a web-based builder is also being considered which runs
on a server with a Golang compiler. The builder could then build Wraith
from source (only takes a few seconds on modern hardware) and send it
to the user as a download. This builder could also be added to the
panel though this would make the panel almost unusable on shared hosting.
