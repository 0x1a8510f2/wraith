**Good news!** Wraith is now somewhat functional. It's very slow, not
very robust, and has no install scripts, but it's a start. Sending
commands and receiving results is now fully supported though so
the wraith can do its job :)

I work on this and my other projects in my spare time so this project 
can take indefinitely long to complete. Contributions are welcome. To 
contribute, please open a pull request.

The project is expected to be fully functional around: 01/03/2020
