All files in this directory ending with .py will be interpreted as
commands to send to the wraith. Each file should contain code which
is meant to be execued when the file's name is used as a command.
For example:

========= example.py =========
print("Example command")
print("This is a test!")
=========            =========

wraith << example
wraith >> Example command\nThis is a test!

Functions and classes should not be defined unless used directly by this
command as all commands will run in separate threads, which will report
to the wraith using a socket.
