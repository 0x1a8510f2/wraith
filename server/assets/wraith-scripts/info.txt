All files in this directory ending with .py will be interpreted as
commands to send to the wraith. Each file should contain code which
is meant to be execued when the file's name is used as a command.
For example:

========= example.py =========
def script_main(wraith, cmdname):
	wraith.putresult("SUCCESS", "Hello")
	wraith.putresult("SUCCESS", "World")
=========            =========

The wraith will always run the function `script_main` with 2
arguments; the wraith object and the name of the script being ran.
Any output will have to manually be caught by the command and sent to
the panel using `wraith.putresult()`. It is strongly recommended that
all code for the module is put under `script_main()` as everything
else will be executed in the main command thread which can block
other commands from running.
